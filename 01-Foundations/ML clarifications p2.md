# Machine Learning Interview Prep - Core Concepts

## 1. Cross-Entropy Loss

### ELI5 Version
Imagine you're playing a guessing game where you have to predict which of 3 boxes contains a prize. Cross-entropy loss measures how "surprised" you are by the actual answer. If you're very confident the prize is in box 1 (you give it 90% probability) but it's actually in box 2, you'll be very surprised and get a high penalty. If you're less confident and spread your predictions more evenly, you'll be less surprised and get a lower penalty.

### Technical Explanation

**Formula:**
For binary classification:
```
Loss = -[y*log(ŷ) + (1-y)*log(1-ŷ)]
```

For multi-class classification:
```
Loss = -Σ(i=1 to C) y_i * log(ŷ_i)
```

Where:
- y = true label (one-hot encoded)
- ŷ = predicted probability
- C = number of classes

**Why it's used:**
- **Probabilistic interpretation**: Directly optimizes for probability estimates
- **Smooth gradients**: Provides strong gradients when predictions are wrong
- **Maximum likelihood**: Equivalent to maximizing likelihood of correct predictions
- **Penalizes confident wrong predictions**: Heavily penalizes overconfident incorrect predictions

### Cross-Entropy vs MSE for Classification

| Aspect | Cross-Entropy | MSE |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Gradient behavior** | Strong gradients for wrong predictions | Weak gradients when very wrong |
| **Probability interpretation** | Natural probability outputs | No direct probability meaning |
| **Convergence** | Faster convergence | Slower, can get stuck |
| **Use case** | Classification problems | Regression problems |

**Example**: Predicting if email is spam (true label = 1, spam)
- Model predicts: 0.1 (10% spam probability)
- Cross-entropy loss: -[1*log(0.1) + 0*log(0.9)] = 2.30
- MSE loss: (1-0.1)² = 0.81

Cross-entropy gives higher penalty for being confidently wrong!

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"Cross-entropy loss is the go-to loss function for classification because it directly optimizes what we care about - getting the right probabilities. Unlike MSE, it gives strong gradients when we're wrong, helping the model learn faster. It heavily penalizes confident wrong predictions, which is exactly what we want in classification."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs
- **Q: Why not use MSE for classification?**
  - A: MSE has vanishing gradients problem and doesn't have probabilistic interpretation
- **Q: What happens with log(0)?**
  - A: Use numerical stability tricks like log(max(ŷ, ε)) where ε = 1e-15
- **Pitfall**: Not applying softmax before cross-entropy (use built-in functions like CrossEntropyLoss)

## 2. Precision-Recall Tradeoff

### ELI5 Version
You're a security guard checking IDs. **Precision** is "Of all the people I said were suspicious, how many actually were?" **Recall** is "Of all the actually suspicious people, how many did I catch?" You can't maximize both - if you flag everyone as suspicious (high recall), most will be innocent (low precision). If you're very picky and only flag obvious cases (high precision), you'll miss many suspicious people (low recall).

### Technical Explanation

**Definitions:**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = "How many selected items are relevant?"
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = "How many relevant items are selected?"
```

**Why they conflict:**
- Lowering classification threshold → More positive predictions → Higher recall, lower precision
- Raising classification threshold → Fewer positive predictions → Higher precision, lower recall

**Mathematical relationship:**
```
F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

### Real-World Tradeoff Examples

1. **Medical Diagnosis (Cancer Screening)**
   - High Recall: Catch all cancer cases (don't miss any!) → Many false alarms
   - High Precision: Only flag obvious cases → Miss early-stage cancers
   - **Decision**: Usually favor recall (better safe than sorry)

2. **Email Spam Detection**
   - High Recall: Catch all spam → Important emails in spam folder
   - High Precision: Only flag obvious spam → Some spam gets through
   - **Decision**: Usually favor precision (don't block important emails)

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - High Recall: Catch all fraud → Many legitimate transactions blocked
   - High Precision: Only flag obvious fraud → Some fraud goes undetected
   - **Decision**: Balance based on cost of false positives vs false negatives

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"Precision and recall have an inverse relationship because of how classification thresholds work. When you lower the threshold to catch more positive cases (increase recall), you inevitably include more false positives (decrease precision). The choice depends on the cost of false positives vs false negatives in your specific business context."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs
- **Q: Can you have high precision AND high recall?**
  - A: Yes, with a very good model, but there's always a tradeoff at the margins
- **Q: Which is more important?**
  - A: Depends on domain - medical diagnosis favors recall, spam detection favors precision
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to consider class imbalance when interpreting precision/recall

---

## 3. Precision-Recall Curve

### ELI5 Version
A precision-recall curve is like a report card showing how your model performs at different "strictness levels." Imagine a teacher grading tests - if they're very strict (high threshold), they'll give A's only to perfect answers (high precision) but miss good students who made small mistakes (low recall). If they're lenient (low threshold), they'll give A's to more students (high recall) but include some who didn't deserve it (low precision). The curve shows this tradeoff.

### Technical Explanation

**Construction:**
1. Sort all predictions by probability score (high to low)
2. For each possible threshold:
   - Calculate precision and recall
   - Plot point (recall, precision)
3. Connect points to form curve

**Mathematical process:**
```
For threshold t in [0, 1]:
    y_pred = (probabilities >= t)
    precision(t) = TP(t) / (TP(t) + FP(t))
    recall(t) = TP(t) / (TP(t) + FN(t))
    Plot (recall(t), precision(t))
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Starting point** (0, 1): Highest threshold, few predictions, high precision
- **Ending point** (1, baseline): Lowest threshold, all positive predictions
- **Baseline**: Random classifier line at y = (# positive samples) / (total samples)

### Threshold Effects

**High Threshold (Right side of curve):**
- Few positive predictions
- High precision (confident predictions)
- Low recall (miss many positives)

**Low Threshold (Left side of curve):**
- Many positive predictions
- Low precision (many false positives)
- High recall (catch most positives)

### Visual Interpretation
```
Precision
    ↑
1.0 |●
    |  ●
    |    ●●
0.8 |      ●●
    |        ●●●
0.6 |           ●●●●
    |              ●●●●●
0.4 |                  ●●●●

0.2 |________________________●●●
    0   0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1.0 → Recall
```

**Good model**: Curve stays high and to the right
**Poor model**: Curve drops quickly or stays near baseline

### Interview-Ready Examples
*"For a fraud detection system, we might use the PR curve to find the optimal threshold. If we need to catch 80% of fraud (0.8 recall), we can read off the curve to see what precision we'll get. The area under the PR curve gives us a single metric to compare models - higher is better."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs
- **Q: Why does the curve look jagged?**
  - A: With finite data, precision can jump when crossing decision boundaries
- **Q: How to choose the best threshold?**
  - A: Depends on business requirements - use F1-score, or optimize for specific recall/precision target
- **Pitfall**: Interpolating between points incorrectly (use step function, not linear)

---

## 4. ROC Curve

### ELI5 Version
ROC curve is like comparing security systems. **True Positive Rate (TPR)** is "How good are you at catching actual intruders?" **False Positive Rate (FPR)** is "How often do you falsely alarm on innocent people?" A perfect system would catch all intruders (TPR=1) while never falsely alarming (FPR=0). The ROC curve shows this tradeoff - as you make the system more sensitive to catch more intruders, you also get more false alarms.

### Technical Explanation

**Definitions:**
```
TPR (Sensitivity) = TP / (TP + FN) = "True Positive Rate"
FPR = FP / (FP + TN) = "False Positive Rate"
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 1 - FPR
```

**Construction:**
1. Sort predictions by probability (high to low)
2. For each threshold:
   - Calculate TPR and FPR
   - Plot point (FPR, TPR)
3. Connect points to form curve

**Key Reference Points:**
- **(0, 0)**: Highest threshold - predict nothing as positive
- **(1, 1)**: Lowest threshold - predict everything as positive  
- **(0, 1)**: Perfect classifier - catch all positives, no false positives
- **Diagonal line**: Random classifier (TPR = FPR)

### How Thresholds Affect ROC

**High Threshold:**
- Conservative predictions
- Low TPR (miss many positives)
- Low FPR (few false alarms)
- Bottom-left of curve

**Low Threshold:**
- Liberal predictions  
- High TPR (catch most positives)
- High FPR (many false alarms)
- Top-right of curve

### Visual Interpretation
```

1.0|    ●●●●
   |  ●●    
   |●●      Perfect: (0,1)

   |●       
0.6|●       
   |●       Good model

0.2|●       Random classifier
   |●_______________________
   0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1.0 → FPR
```

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"ROC curves show how well a model separates classes across all thresholds. The closer the curve is to the top-left corner, the better the model. Unlike PR curves, ROC curves are less sensitive to class imbalance because they look at rates within each class separately."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs
- **Q: What's a good ROC curve?**
  - A: Curve should bow toward top-left corner; AUC > 0.7 is decent, > 0.8 is good
- **Q: ROC vs PR curve - which to use?**
  - A: ROC for balanced datasets, PR for imbalanced datasets
- **Pitfall**: Using ROC AUC for highly imbalanced datasets (can be misleadingly optimistic)

---

## 5. AUC (Area Under Curve)

### ELI5 Version
AUC is like a report card grade for your model. It's a single number between 0 and 1 that summarizes how good your model is. Think of it as asking: "If I randomly pick one positive example and one negative example, what's the probability my model will rank the positive one higher?" AUC = 0.5 means your model is no better than flipping a coin. AUC = 1.0 means your model is perfect.

### Technical Explanation

**Definition:**
AUC = Area Under the ROC Curve = P(model ranks positive example higher than negative example)

**Mathematical Interpretation:**
```
AUC = ∫₀¹ TPR(FPR⁻¹(x)) dx
```

**Probabilistic Interpretation:**
```
AUC = P(score(positive_sample) > score(negative_sample))
```

**Properties:**
- **Range**: [0, 1]
- **Random classifier**: AUC = 0.5
- **Perfect classifier**: AUC = 1.0
- **Scale-invariant**: Measures ranking quality, not absolute probabilities
- **Classification-threshold-invariant**: Single metric across all thresholds

### Interpretation Guidelines
| AUC Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Excellent |
| 0.8 - 0.9 | Good |
| 0.7 - 0.8 | Fair |
| 0.6 - 0.7 | Poor |
| 0.5 - 0.6 | Fail |

### Limitations

1. **Class Imbalance Insensitivity**
   - Can be overly optimistic with imbalanced datasets
   - Example: 99% negative class → high AUC even with poor precision

2. **Equal Weighting of Errors**
   - Treats all misclassifications equally
   - May not reflect business costs

3. **Threshold Independence**
   - Doesn't help choose optimal threshold
   - Summarizes performance across all thresholds

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"AUC-ROC gives us a single number to compare models by measuring how well they rank positive examples higher than negative ones. It's threshold-independent, making it great for model comparison. However, for imbalanced datasets, AUC-PR is often more informative because it focuses on performance on the minority class."*

### Common Follow-up Questions & Answers
- **Q: Can AUC be below 0.5?**
  - A: Technically yes, but it means you can flip predictions and get AUC > 0.5
- **Q: AUC-ROC vs AUC-PR?**
  - A: ROC for balanced data, PR for imbalanced data
- **Q: How to improve AUC?**
  - A: Better features, more data, different algorithms, ensemble methods
- **Pitfall**: Using AUC-ROC as the only metric for imbalanced problems

## 6. When to use AUC-PR vs AUC-ROC

### ELI5 Version
Imagine you're looking for rare gems (positive class) in a pile of mostly rocks (negative class). **AUC-ROC** is like asking "How good are you at telling gems from rocks overall?" **AUC-PR** is like asking "When you say something is a gem, how often are you right, and how many gems do you find?" When gems are rare (imbalanced data), the second question (AUC-PR) is much more important because you care more about finding gems than correctly identifying rocks.

### Technical Explanation

**The Key Difference:**
- **ROC**: Uses True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate
- **PR**: Uses Precision and Recall

**Why this matters for imbalance:**
```
In imbalanced datasets (e.g., 1% positive):
- FPR = FP / (FP + TN) ← large TN makes FPR look good
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) ← directly affected by FP
```

### Dataset Imbalance Effects

**Balanced Dataset (50/50 split):**
- Both AUC-ROC and AUC-PR are informative
- Similar insights from both curves
- ROC curve shows clear separation

**Imbalanced Dataset (1% positive):**
- **AUC-ROC**: Can be misleadingly high (large TN dominates FPR)
- **AUC-PR**: More realistic view of performance on minority class
- ROC curve may look good while PR curve reveals poor precision

### Practical Decision Framework

| Scenario | Use AUC-ROC | Use AUC-PR |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Balanced classes** | ✅ Primary metric | ✅ Secondary check |
| **Imbalanced classes** | ⚠️ Supplementary only | ✅ Primary metric |
| **Cost of FP = Cost of FN** | ✅ Good choice | ✅ Also good |
| **Care about minority class** | ❌ Can be misleading | ✅ Perfect fit |
| **Equal concern for both classes** | ✅ Good choice | ⚠️ Less informative |

### Real-World Examples

1. **Fraud Detection (0.1% fraud rate)**
   - **Use AUC-PR**: Care about catching fraud (recall) and avoiding false flags (precision)
   - **Why not ROC**: 99.9% legitimate transactions make FPR look artificially good

2. **Medical Diagnosis (5% disease rate)**
   - **Use AUC-PR**: Focus on catching disease cases accurately
   - **Why not ROC**: Large healthy population dominates specificity

3. **A/B Testing (50/50 split)**
   - **Use AUC-ROC**: Both variants equally important
   - **PR also fine**: Both metrics give similar insights

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"The choice between AUC-ROC and AUC-PR depends on class balance and what you care about. For imbalanced datasets, use AUC-PR because ROC can be misleadingly optimistic - the large negative class makes specificity look good even when precision is poor. AUC-PR directly focuses on performance on the minority class, which is usually what matters in imbalanced problems."*

### Common Pitfalls & Best Practices
- **Pitfall**: Using only AUC-ROC for imbalanced data (can miss poor precision)
- **Pitfall**: Ignoring baseline precision in PR curves
- **Best Practice**: Report both metrics but emphasize the appropriate one
- **Best Practice**: Always consider the business context and costs of different errors

## 7. Ordinal Encoding

### ELI5 Version
Ordinal encoding is like giving medals at the Olympics - 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place. The numbers have a meaningful order: 1st is better than 2nd, which is better than 3rd. You use ordinal encoding when your categories have a natural ranking, like "small, medium, large" or "poor, fair, good, excellent." You wouldn't use it for colors like "red, blue, green" because blue isn't "bigger" than red.

### Technical Explanation

**What it is:**
Ordinal encoding maps categorical variables to integers that preserve the natural ordering of categories.

**Example mapping:**
```
Education Level: ["High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "PhD"]
Ordinal Encoding: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Size: ["Small", "Medium", "Large", "XL"]  
Ordinal Encoding: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Mathematical representation:**
```python
# Manual mapping
education_map = {"High School": 1, "Bachelor's": 2, "Master's": 3, "PhD": 4}

# Or using LabelEncoder for simplicity
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(["Small", "Medium", "Large"])
# Output: [2, 1, 0] (alphabetical by default - need manual mapping for true ordinal)
```

### When Ordinal Encoding is Appropriate

**✅ Good use cases:**
- **Rankings**: "Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent"
- **Sizes**: "XS, S, M, L, XL"  
- **Education levels**: "High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD"
- **Satisfaction scores**: "Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied"
- **Frequency**: "Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always"

**❌ Inappropriate use cases:**
- **Nominal categories**: Colors, countries, product names
- **No clear ordering**: Department names, categorical IDs
- **Arbitrary groupings**: User segments without inherent ranking

### Limitations & Assumptions

1. **Assumes Linear Relationships**
   - Model treats difference between 1→2 same as 2→3
   - May not reflect reality (PhD vs Master's ≠ Master's vs Bachelor's)

2. **Distance Assumptions**
   - Ordinal: "Poor"(1), "Fair"(2), "Good"(3), "Excellent"(4)
   - Model assumes Fair-Poor = Good-Fair = Excellent-Good
   - Reality: Gaps might not be equal

3. **Magnitude Sensitivity**
   - Choice of numbers matters: [1,2,3,4] vs [1,10,100,1000]
   - Can artificially amplify relationships

### Alternatives & When to Use Them

| Alternative | When to Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **One-Hot Encoding** | When order doesn't matter strongly | T-shirt sizes for fashion (style > size) |
| **Target Encoding** | When relationship with target is non-monotonic | Education level vs income (complex relationship) |
| **Custom Numeric Mapping** | When you know true distances | Years of experience: [0, 2, 5, 10+] |
| **Polynomial Features** | When relationship is non-linear | Size²for area calculations |

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"Ordinal encoding assigns integers to categories that have a natural order, like education levels or satisfaction ratings. It's simple and preserves ordinality, but assumes equal spacing between categories and linear relationships. Use it when order matters and relationships are roughly linear. For complex relationships or when order doesn't matter, consider one-hot encoding or target encoding instead."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs
- **Q: Should I always use ordinal encoding for rankings?**
  - A: Not always - if relationship with target is non-monotonic, one-hot might be better
- **Q: How do I handle missing values?**
  - A: Treat as separate category or use domain knowledge for placement
- **Pitfall**: Using arbitrary numbers instead of meaningful rankings
- **Pitfall**: Applying to nominal variables (colors, names) where order doesn't exist

---

## 8. Target Encoding

### ELI5 Version
Target encoding is like asking "What's the average salary of people from each city?" instead of just knowing which city someone is from. If people from San Francisco average $120k and people from Cleveland average $60k, you replace "San Francisco" with 120,000 and "Cleveland" with 60,000. It's powerful because it directly tells you how each category relates to what you're trying to predict. But be careful - if you only have one person from a city, that average might be misleading!

### Technical Explanation

**Basic Formula:**
```
target_encoding(category_i) = mean(target | category = category_i)
```

**For binary classification:**
```
target_encoding(category_i) = P(target = 1 | category = category_i)
```

**For regression:**
```
target_encoding(category_i) = E[target | category = category_i]
```

**Example:**
```
City        Target (Salary)    Count    Target Encoding
--------    --------------    -------   ---------------
NYC         [100K,120K,110K]     3         110,000
Austin      [80K,90K]            2          85,000  
Seattle     [130K]               1         130,000
```

### Advanced Techniques

**1. Smoothing (Regularization):**
```
smoothed_encoding = (count * category_mean + alpha * global_mean) / (count + alpha)
```
Where alpha is smoothing parameter (typically 10-100)

**2. Cross-Validation Encoding:**
```python
# Prevents data leakage
for fold in cv_folds:
    train_fold, val_fold = split_data(fold)
    category_means = compute_means(train_fold)
    val_fold['encoded'] = val_fold['category'].map(category_means)
```

**3. Noise Addition:**
```
encoded_value = category_mean + random_noise
```

### Data Leakage Risks

**The Problem:**
Target encoding uses the target variable to create features, which can cause overfitting if not done carefully.

**Example of leakage:**
```python
# WRONG - uses entire dataset
category_means = df.groupby('category')['target'].mean()
df['encoded'] = df['category'].map(category_means)

# CORRECT - uses cross-validation
encoder = TargetEncoder(cv=5)
df['encoded'] = encoder.fit_transform(df[['category']], df['target'])
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Model sees future information during training
- Artificially inflated performance on validation
- Poor generalization to new data

### Best Practices

1. **Always use cross-validation** or holdout validation
2. **Apply smoothing** for categories with few samples
3. **Handle unseen categories** with global mean
4. **Monitor for overfitting** with proper validation
5. **Consider interaction effects** between categories

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"Target encoding replaces categorical variables with the mean target value for each category. It's powerful because it directly captures the relationship between categories and the target. However, it's prone to overfitting and data leakage, so you must use cross-validation or holdout sets when computing the encodings. It works especially well for high-cardinality categorical variables where one-hot encoding would create too many features."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs

**Q: When should I use target encoding vs one-hot encoding?**
- A: Target encoding for high-cardinality categoricals (>10-20 categories) or when categories have clear relationship with target

**Q: How do I handle categories not seen in training?**
- A: Use global mean as fallback, or treat as missing value

**Q: What if a category has only one sample?**
- A: Use smoothing to blend with global mean, or set minimum sample threshold

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Using entire dataset** to compute encodings (data leakage)
- **No smoothing** for low-frequency categories
- **Forgetting to handle unseen categories** in production
- **Not validating properly** leading to overfitting

## 9. Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT/GBM)

### ELI5 Version
Imagine you're trying to predict house prices, but your first guess is off by $50k. Instead of starting over, you train a second model to predict that $50k error. Then you train a third model to predict the remaining error, and so on. Each new model tries to fix the mistakes of the previous models. That's gradient boosting - you build a team of "weak" models that work together to make one strong prediction by learning from each other's mistakes.

### Technical Explanation

**Core Algorithm:**
1. **Initialize** with simple prediction (e.g., mean of targets)
2. **For each iteration:**
   - Calculate residuals (errors) from current model
   - Train new weak learner to predict residuals
   - Add this learner to ensemble with small weight
   - Update predictions
3. **Final prediction** = sum of all weighted weak learners

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
F₀(x) = initial_prediction (e.g., mean)

For m = 1 to M:
    # Calculate pseudo-residuals
    r_im = -∂L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i))/∂F_{m-1}(x_i)
    
    # Fit weak learner to residuals
    h_m(x) = fit_model(x, r_im)
    
    # Find optimal step size
    γ_m = argmin_γ Σ L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + γ*h_m(x_i))
    
    # Update ensemble
    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + γ_m * h_m(x)

Final: F_M(x) = F₀(x) + Σ γ_m * h_m(x)
```

### Algorithm Steps (Detailed)

**Step 1: Initialize**
```python
F₀(x) = mean(y)  # For regression
F₀(x) = log(p/(1-p))  # For classification (log-odds)
```

**Step 2: Iterative Boosting**
```python
for m in range(1, M+1):
    # Calculate residuals
    residuals = y - F_{m-1}(x)
    
    # Fit decision tree to residuals
    tree_m = DecisionTree(max_depth=3)
    tree_m.fit(X, residuals)
    
    # Add to ensemble
    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + learning_rate * tree_m.predict(x)
```

### GBT vs Random Forest Comparison

| Aspect | Gradient Boosting | Random Forest |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Training** | Sequential (one tree at a time) | Parallel (independent trees) |
| **Error correction** | Each tree fixes previous errors | Each tree trained independently |
| **Overfitting** | More prone (sequential dependence) | More robust (averaging effect) |
| **Speed** | Slower training | Faster training |
| **Interpretability** | Feature importance via gain | Feature importance via impurity |
| **Hyperparameters** | More tuning needed | Fewer hyperparameters |
| **Performance** | Often higher accuracy | Good accuracy, more stable |

### Strengths & Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
- **High predictive accuracy** on structured/tabular data
- **Handles mixed data types** (numerical + categorical)
- **Built-in feature selection** via tree splits
- **Robust to outliers** (tree-based)
- **No need for feature scaling**
- **Captures non-linear relationships** and interactions

**Weaknesses:**
- **Prone to overfitting** without careful tuning
- **Sequential training** (can't parallelize easily)
- **Many hyperparameters** to tune
- **Less interpretable** than single decision tree
- **Sensitive to noisy data** in sequential learning
- **Memory intensive** for large datasets

### Key Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Effect | Typical Values |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **n_estimators** | Number of trees | 100-1000 |
| **learning_rate** | Step size | 0.01-0.3 |
| **max_depth** | Tree complexity | 3-8 |
| **subsample** | Row sampling | 0.8-1.0 |
| **colsample_bytree** | Feature sampling | 0.8-1.0 |
| **min_child_weight** | Minimum samples per leaf | 1-10 |

### Practical Applications

**Where GBT excels:**
- **Tabular data competitions** (Kaggle)
- **Structured business problems** (sales forecasting, risk modeling)
- **Feature-rich problems** with mixed data types
- **Non-linear relationships** between features

**Example domains:**
- Customer churn prediction
- Credit scoring
- Web click-through rates
- Medical diagnosis from lab results
- Recommendation systems (ranking)

### Interview-Ready Explanation
*"Gradient boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the errors of the previous ensemble. Unlike random forest which trains trees independently, GBT learns from mistakes iteratively. This often leads to higher accuracy but requires more careful tuning to avoid overfitting. It's the go-to algorithm for structured data problems where you need high predictive performance."*

### Common Pitfalls & FAQs

**Q: How do you prevent overfitting in GBT?**
- A: Lower learning rate, limit tree depth, use early stopping, apply regularization (L1/L2)

**Q: Why use weak learners (shallow trees)?**
- A: Deep trees can memorize training data; shallow trees focus on general patterns

**Q: How to choose learning rate vs number of estimators?**
- A: Lower learning rate + more estimators = better performance but slower training

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Too high learning rate** → overfitting
- **Too deep trees** → memorization
- **No early stopping** → training past optimal point
- **Ignoring feature scaling** (not needed but can help with interpretability)
- **Not tuning regularization** parameters

## Summary & Quick Reference

### Model Selection Cheat Sheet
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Classification problems (always prefer over MSE)
- **Precision vs Recall**: Business context determines priority
- **AUC-ROC**: Balanced datasets, overall ranking quality
- **AUC-PR**: Imbalanced datasets, minority class focus
- **Ordinal Encoding**: Natural ordering exists, linear relationships
- **Target Encoding**: High cardinality, strong category-target relationship
- **Gradient Boosting**: Structured data, need highest accuracy

### Interview Red Flags to Avoid
1. Using MSE for classification
2. Using AUC-ROC only for imbalanced data
3. Target encoding without cross-validation
4. Ordinal encoding for nominal variables
5. Ignoring class imbalance in metric selection
6. Not considering business costs in precision-recall tradeoff

### Key Formulas to Remember
```
Cross-Entropy: -Σ y_i * log(ŷ_i)
Precision: TP / (TP + FP)
Recall: TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
AUC interpretation: P(score(positive) > score(negative))
Target Encoding: E[target | category = c]
```
