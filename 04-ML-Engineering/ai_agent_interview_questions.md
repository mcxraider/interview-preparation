### Q26. What is task decomposition in agentic AI?

**Answer:** Task decomposition involves breaking down a complex goal into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Agents often use hierarchical planning or recursive strategies to solve these sub-tasks, improving scalability and modularity in decision-making.

## Advanced Frameworks & Multi-Agent Systems (Questions 27-30)

### Q27. How does LangChain enable agentic behavior?

**Answer:** LangChain supports agentic behavior by integrating LLMs with external tools (APIs, databases), memory (to track context), and chaining mechanisms (for reasoning). It allows agents to observe, decide, and act iteratively toward complex goals using prompts and plugins.

### Q28. What is a memory module in frameworks like AutoGPT or BabyAGI?

**Answer:** A memory module stores past actions, results, observations, and intermediate decisions. It enables continuity across iterations, allowing agents to avoid redundancy, learn from prior steps, and maintain long-term coherence in multi-step tasks.

### Q29. How is agent routing implemented in multi-agent orchestration systems?

**Answer:** Agent routing refers to directing tasks or subtasks to the most suitable agent in a multi-agent system. It's implemented using logic-based controllers, role definitions, or skill tags. Frameworks like AutoGen or CrewAI handle routing via pre-defined roles or dynamic delegation.

### Q30. Describe a use case where a multi-agent system provides better outcomes than a single-agent system.

**Answer:** **Hospital Operations Example:** A multi-agent system with separate agents for patient monitoring, resource allocation, and appointment scheduling can dynamically collaborate to:
